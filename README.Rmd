# helpdesk

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of helpdesk is to create a quick api to query URL links embedded in DESCRPITION files of the `installed.packages`.

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("yonicd/helpdesk")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(helpdesk)
```

### Interactive

In RStudio IDE an interactive [datatable](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) will be returned in which search fields at the top of the columns is enabled by default to further query the output. 

After locating the relevant link you need, the links are enabled to open directly into a new browser tab.

Here is an example

That's it!

### Static

Below shows some additional functionality, where the returned objects are converted to htm tables. Like before the links are active so you can test them out from the outputs.

#### Default

returns a table of all the packages with URLs in the DESCRIPTION file

```{r}
x <- help.pages()
nrow(x)
knitr::kable(head(x))
```

#### Subset of packages

```{r}
knitr::kable(help.pages(c('dplyr','ggplot2')))
```

#### Using partial matches of package names

```{r}
knitr::kable(help.pages('tidy',regex = TRUE))
```

#### Using partial matches of function names in the help title field

```{r}
knitr::kable(help.pages(function_pattern = 'geom'))
```
